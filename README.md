# TownPolling
A singular file used for polling analysis from my internship on an Executive Council campaign. Towns that had been won by my candidate's party in the previous presidential election  are indicated in yellow to indicate priority. Votes in the executive council race are compared to state senators, senators, and presidential primary candidates from the same district and party.
